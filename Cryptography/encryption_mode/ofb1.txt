This is a sample text file to test the encryption mode OFB (output feedback mode). OFB can be used to produce a stream cipher, and the plaintext is encrypted by simply XOR-ing it with the key stream. In this example, we shall look at a basic vulnerability of OFB related to the use of IV. Reusing the same IV to encrypt two or more files will allow the attacker to learn some information about the plaintext or the keystream.  Figure out how the attack works and use it to decrypt the ofb2.enc provied in this exercise...........................................................................................................................................................
