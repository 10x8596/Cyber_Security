Congratulations! You have managed to recover this plaintext from the encrypted version without knowing the key. An important thing to note when using the OFB encryption mode is never reuse the same IV to encrypt more than one file. If the attacker knows the plaintext and the ciphertext of a particular file, by computing the XOR of the two files, the attacker will be able to obtain the keystream. Since the keystream generated using OFB is completely determined by the IV, reusing the IV to encrypt another file means that the exact same keystream will be used. By XOR-ing the keystream with the target ciphertext, we can obtain the plaintext of the target of the attack.
