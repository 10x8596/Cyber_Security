This is designed to introduce you to python classes, and familarise yourself with the Ceaser Cipher system. You need to complete the `encrypt()` and `decrypt()` functions.

A one-time pad is uncrackable ([Terms and Conditions apply](https://medium.com/@canuteson/cracking-a-one-time-pad-a716a804d5bd)<sup>*</sup>). In the one-time pad encryption method , we need a key that is as long as the original message and each character in the original message is encrypted according to the character at the same position of the key. For example, for the same message 'attackatdawn' and given key 'sdifbsnoqwef', the first letter 'a' becomes 's' ('a' + 's' -> 's'), the second letter 't' becomes 'w' ('t' + 'd' -> 'w'), and so on.

    "This question asks you to implement a simplified DES algorithm. DES is not (and [should not](https://www.freeswan.org/freeswan_trees/freeswan-1.5/doc/DES.html) be) used in day to day encrpytion, however since it was one of the first block cipher algorithms and unbreakable for it's time, it is a notable example. In this question, you get the lucky opportunity to implement the DES algorithm. Notice the small keys, which makes it very easy to crack.\n",
    "*****\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Generation: ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: The first step is to select a key 10-bits, which is to be shared between sender and receiver. For example, we select 1010000010 in our case.\n",
    "<b>Note: DES use 56-bit key.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Do a permutation by putting this key into P10 Table and permute the bits. Permutation here means reordering bits with given rules. P10 table is simply a 10-bit long number vector, which indicates the i-th bit in the source sequence, should be changed to the P10[i]-th bit in the target sequence. For example, given P10 table [3, 5, 2, 7, 4, 10, 1, 9, 8, 6], we know the 4-th bit in the target sequence should be the 7-th bit (which is 0) in the source sequence since P10[4] = 7. Our example key 1010000010 will be permutated to 1000001100 with the given P10 table. Let's call it p10-key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Divide the p10-key into two parts from the middle, and we will get left (10000) and right (01100) keys. We will generate two 8-bits keys <b>(DES use 48-bit subkeys)</b> for two-round encryption. <b>(DES has 16 rounds of encryption, thus, 16 sub keys.)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: To generate first key, we do a 1-bit round shift on both left and right key and concatenate the left and right keys and do a P8 permutation. P8 permutation is similar to P10, except for using a 8-bit long number vector so we will get a 8-bit sequence as result. In our example, by doing the round bit shift we will get 00001 and **11000** (Note: keep these two keys since we will need them to generate the second key). Concatenating the two parts results in **0000111000**. After permutating with P8 table [6, 3, 7, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9] we will get first key k1 = 10100100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: To generate second key, we do the similar thing as described in Step 4. The difference is, this time we do a 2-bit round shift on the resulting left and right keys from Step 4. Thus, we do 2-bit round shift of 00001 and **11000** and get 00100 (left) and **00011** (right). Then concatenate and permutated in the same way described in Step 4. Our second key k2 = 01000011.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encryption:  ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Suppose our source text is 01110010 <b>(The source text is 8 bits in SDES and 64 bits in DES)</b>. Permute the source text with IP (initial permutation) table [2, 6, 3, 1, 4, 8, 5, 7]. The output is 10101001. Then we break the output from the middle and get left part (1010) and right part (1001). \n",
    "\n",
    "Step2: Then we will use a complex function f (including permutation and substitution operations) which tranform the output from initial permutation to another 8-bit sequence.\n",
    "1. permute the right part (1001) with Expand Table E [4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1]. This table expands the 4-bit right part into a 8-bit sequence **11000011**. \n",
    "2. do a bit-wise XOR with our first key k1 (10100100) and get **01100111**.\n",
    "3. Then, split the output into two equal parts from the middle and get left (**0110**) and right (**0111**).\n",
    "4. Put the left and right part into S1 and S2 boxes (S indicates substitution) and combine the result. Substitution returns a 4-bit sequence 1011 \n",
    "5. Permute the 4-bit sequence with P4 table and get 0111\n",
    "6. Do XOR this 4-bit sequence (0111) with the left part of initial permutation (in Step 1), which is 1010. 0111 XOR 1010 = 1101.\n",
    "7. Combine the result from last step with the right part of initial permutation (in Step 1), which is 1001. This will result in 11011001\n",
    "\n",
    "Step3: Split the result from Step2, swap right and left part and combine again. We will get 10011100. Then, we use function f again on this swapped sequence (which means, repeat Step 2). The only difference is we will use second key k2 for XOR operation in Step2.2. We will get 11101101.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step4: Do a Initial Permutation (IP) Inverse on result from Step3 (11101101) and we will get the final result  **01110111**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Decryption: ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Decryption is very similar to encryption. To decrypt a message, we only need to swap the order of subkeys, which means using second key in Step2 and first key in Step 3."

    "In this question, you will be implementing a simplified RSA algorithm. RSA has been available for over 25 years, to varying key lengths. The algorithm is designed such that varying keys can be used, and larger keys generally mean larger security (as the factorisation becomes more computationally intensive). For many years, RSA Laboratories ran a competition to determine whether people can factorise (read: break) the RSA algorithm at varying key lengths. Although the competition is now withdrawn, many loyal researchers still continue to determine new and faster ways to break the algorithm. Most recently, [RSA-240 (a 795-bit key) was broken](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/12/03/new-rsa-factoring/). At this stage, while RSA-1024 is currently considered the most popular, RSA-2048 or RSA-4096 are considered safe (for now). \n",
